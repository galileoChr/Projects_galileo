This project focuses on trading financial instruments using expert advisors.

An expert advisor is essentially a software that provides trading timing recommendations. 

The programme chooses which strategies to use depending on certain trading criterias, so that 
an open and close transaction can be done on my behalf. It's coded using MetaTrader 5's high level language called MQL5.

These are bots that can interact with various markets, especially Forex, with
the intent to make profits through various trades along the day
This project is still being developed, and it provided me with a chance to work with software that can actually interact
with live financial securities.
