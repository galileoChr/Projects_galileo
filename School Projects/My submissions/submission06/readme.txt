Every part of the website is working fine. Except the ShoppingCartAddItem.php 
where I can't seem to tell the customer to try using a quantity less than available
items. When they try to use a quantity greater than the # in stock, it doesn't redirect
to shoppingCart, rather it stays on ShoppingCartAddItem.php with a header warning.
