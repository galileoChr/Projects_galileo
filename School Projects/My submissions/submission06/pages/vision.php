        <h3>About Platinum-ish: Our Vision and Mission</h3>
        <p>
          Platinum-ish is a new business, and this is how it got started.
          In the process of traveling the world, we and some of our friends
          had come across many amazing products, and in the process of 
          sharing stories about the things we had seen, we somehow got
          the idea that bringing these products back home and making them
          available to others might be a good idea and even, we hoped, a
          good business model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course it is well known that, "One man's treasure is another
          man's garbage." Thus we cannot expect that everything we find
          amazing, or even iteresting, will excite the same level of
          admiration in others. However, we think that each of the items
          we present is "objectively amazing" at some level, and we hope
          that you will agree.
